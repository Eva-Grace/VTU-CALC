# VTU-CALC
This is a project that allows the user to calculate their SGPA or CGPA easily
The user first needs to sign-up and register, if already a member, then they can just go to the sign-in page and enter the credentials to move forward. 
Once the credentials are verified and exact, the user is asked to choose what they want to calculate(SGPA/CGPA).
If the decision was to calculate the SGPA, then the SGPA calculator opens up and the user is asked to enter details about the Scheme, Branch and semester. If the semester is either 1 or 2, then the choice of cycle is provided. Once the submit button is clicked the subjects pertaining to the information provided is displayed and the user can enter their their respective grade points within the range 0-10 only and the SGPA is calculated. The calculated SGPA page can also be saved as pdf.
To calculate the CGPA, the user needs to choose the number of semesters for which it needs to be calculated. Once provided, the SGPA for those semesters needs to be entered which must lie in the range 0-10 only and the CGPA will be calculated. The calculated CGPA page can also be saved as pdf.
At any point, the user can decide to logout.
